# GPT-image-1 Token Optimization & Bug Fixes

## Key Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå **Missing `response_format` Parameter**
**Problem**: Your code wasn't specifying `response_format: "b64_json"` which is REQUIRED for GPT-image-1 according to the official documentation.

**Fix**: Added `"response_format": "b64_json"` to both `images.generate` and `images.edit` calls.

**Impact**: This was likely causing the API to return URLs instead of base64 data, leading to failed image saves and potentially higher costs.

### 2. ‚ùå **Incorrect Parameter Usage**
**Problem**: You were using `output_format` as a top-level parameter, but according to the docs, it should be handled differently.

**Fix**: 
- Only add `output_format` parameter when it's not PNG (the default)
- Only add `output_compression` for JPEG/WebP formats
- Only set `background: "transparent"` when explicitly requested (not "auto")

### 3. ‚ùå **Inefficient Reference Image Processing**
**Problem**: Over-complicated reference image handling that could cause API errors.

**Fix**: Simplified the reference image processing to match the official documentation examples.

### 4. üí∞ **Token Cost Optimization Tips**

Based on the official documentation:

#### **Choose Quality Wisely**
- **Low Quality** (272-408 tokens): $0.011-$0.016 per image
- **Medium Quality** (1056-1584 tokens): $0.042-$0.063 per image  
- **High Quality** (4160-6240 tokens): $0.167-$0.25 per image

#### **Size Impact on Tokens**
- **Square (1024√ó1024)**: Fewer tokens than rectangular
- **Portrait/Landscape**: More tokens due to higher pixel count

#### **Avoid Unnecessary Parameters**
- Don't specify parameters that match defaults
- Use `quality: "auto"` to let the model choose optimal settings
- Only use compression settings when needed

### 5. ‚úÖ **Confirmed: GPT-image-1 Model Exists**
The documentation confirms that `gpt-image-1` is real and available through:
- **Image API**: `images.generate` and `images.edit` endpoints
- **Responses API**: As an image generation tool

### 6. üîß **Additional Optimizations Made**

1. **Proper Error Handling**: Better error messages for common GPT-image-1 issues
2. **Parameter Validation**: Only send parameters when they differ from defaults
3. **Response Format**: Ensured proper base64 handling as per documentation
4. **Reference Image Limits**: Properly handle the 10-image limit mentioned in docs

### 7. üìä **Expected Token Savings**

With these fixes, you should see:
- **Reduced API errors** = fewer failed requests = lower costs
- **Proper parameter usage** = optimal token consumption
- **Correct response handling** = no wasted API calls due to parsing errors

### 8. üöÄ **Recommended Settings for Cost Efficiency**

For **development/testing**:
```python
quality="low"        # 272 tokens = $0.011 per square image
size="1024x1024"     # Smallest token count
output_format="jpeg" # Faster processing
```

For **production/high-quality**:
```python
quality="auto"       # Let model choose optimal quality
size="1024x1024"     # Balance between quality and cost
output_format="png"  # Best quality, transparency support
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ The main image generation function has been fixed
2. üîç Test the application with debug mode enabled to verify the fixes
3. üìä Monitor token usage - should be significantly reduced
4. üéØ Consider implementing quality presets based on use case

## Questions to Test

1. Does image generation work without errors now?
2. Are images being saved properly as base64?
3. Is token consumption reduced compared to before?
4. Are reference images working correctly with the edit endpoint?
